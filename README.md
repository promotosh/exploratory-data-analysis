 

## üõ† Projects Overview  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Bergen Bysykkel Data Analysis**  
**Objective:**  
- Investigate whether Bergen Bysykkel ride data can serve as a proxy for bicycle counts from The Norwegian Public Roads Administration.  
- Develop an automated pipeline to fetch, clean, and analyze data over multiple days.

**Key Tasks:**  
- Data collection from public APIs.  
- Data wrangling: filtering, cleaning, and merging datasets.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including visualizations such as scatter plots.  
- Automation strategies for continuous data updates.

**Tools & Technologies:**  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- API handling and automation  
- Data visualization and statistical analysis

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Bean Classification Using Machine Learning**  
**Objective:**  
- Develop an image-based classification system to sort different types of beans using machine learning techniques.  
- Optimize model performance to automate the sorting process in a production environment.

**Key Tasks:**  
- Data preprocessing (handling outliers, encoding categorical data).  
- Feature engineering and selection from various bean attributes (e.g., area, perimeter, eccentricity).  
- Model experimentation with different algorithms (e.g., SVM, Decision Trees).  
- Performance evaluation using confusion matrices and classification metrics.

**Tools & Technologies:**  
- Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas)  
- Model evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score)  
- Confusion matrix visualization
